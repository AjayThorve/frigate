description: A rich nginx Helm chart example.
long_description: |
    This is the default chart created with ``helm create nginx``.
    Descriptions have then been added to all items in ``values.yaml`` and a ``.frigate.jinja2`` template has been included to enrich it.

    Frigate has then been used to generate both the ``README.rst`` in that directory as well as the example in the Sphinx docs.

    Generating the README.rst
    -------------------------

    .. code-block:: console

       $ frigate gen ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/rich > ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/rich/README.rst

    Sphinx docs directive
    ---------------------

    .. code-block:: rst

       .. frigate:: ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/rich

    Footnotes
    ---------

    It is also possible to include a footnotes section which is placed after the parameters table in your documentation.

    This is a good location for information which you want to include but may not be of primary interest to users.
