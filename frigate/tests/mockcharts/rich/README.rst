Rich
======================

A rich nginx Helm chart example.

This is the default chart created with ``helm create nginx``.
Descriptions have then been added to all items in ``values.yaml`` and a ``.frigate.jinja2`` template has been included to enrich it.

Frigate has then been used to generate both the ``README.rst`` in that directory as well as the example in the Sphinx docs.

Generating the README.rst
-------------------------

.. code-block:: console

   $ frigate gen ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/rich > ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/rich/README.rst

Sphinx docs directive
---------------------

.. code-block:: rst

   .. frigate:: ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/rich


Configuration
-------------

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Rich chart and their default values.

Footnotes
---------

It is also possible to include a footnotes section which is placed after the parameters table in your documentation.

This is a good location for information which you want to include but may not be of primary interest to users.
