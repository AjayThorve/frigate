Sphinx extension
================

Frigate can also automatically document your Helm charts right in your Sphinx_ documentation.

Setup
------

- `Install Frigate`_.

- Enable the plugin in your Sphinx ``conf.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = ['frigate.sphinx.ext']

- Now you can use the ``frigate`` directive wherever you wish in your documentation.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. frigate:: path/to/your/helm/chart

.. note::
   Frigate paths are relative to the root of your documentation.

Example
--------

*The following was autogenerated from the nginx example chart in Frigate's test suite.*

-----------

.. frigate:: ../frigate/tests/mockcharts/nginx

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/
.. _`Install Frigate`: index.html#installation
